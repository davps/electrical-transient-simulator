Simulator of electrical transients on transmission lines 
===============================================================================

This repository contains the source code of a simulator of electrical transients on transmission lines using Lattice Diagrams.

### Introduction
This is a project that I developed in 2010 when I was studying Transmission of Energy at my university (Universidad Nacional del Este. 

I make some simplifications:
* The voltage source is DC
* The software accept just pure resistive impedances

### Theory of Lattice Diagrams

A brief theory about Lattice Diagrams can be found here `http://download.intel.com/education/highered/signal/elct762/class06_transmission_line_basics.ppt`


### Who can use this software?

This software could be a great resource for teachers and students of transmission lines.

### Technologies behind this simulator

I developed it using Flex 3 framework. 

### Live demo

A live demo can be found here
